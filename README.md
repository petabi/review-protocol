# review-protocol

review-protocol serves as an application-level protocol implementation for the
REview ecosystem, utilizing QUIC for communication between agents. It builds
upon the message exchange framework provided by [oinq], focusing on high-level
operations, data manipulation, and protocol-specific features tailored to
facilitate efficient and secure communication within the REview ecosystem.

## Features

- **Bidirectional Request/Response**: High-level APIs for RPC-style
  communication
- **Unidirectional Event Streams**: Efficient handling of event streams from
  agents with protocol encapsulation
- **Type-safe Protocol**: Strongly typed message formats with Serde
  serialization
- **Connection Management**: Built-in handshake and connection lifecycle
  management
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with custom recovery options

## Unidirectional Event Stream API

The crate provides a high-level API for handling unidirectional event streams,
encapsulating protocol details behind a clean trait-based interface.

### Basic Usage

Implement the `EventStreamHandler` trait to process events:

```rust
use review_protocol::{server::EventStreamHandler, types::EventMessage};

struct MyEventHandler;

#[async_trait::async_trait]
impl EventStreamHandler for MyEventHandler {
    async fn handle_event(&mut self, event: EventMessage) -> std::io::Result<()> {
        println!("Received event: {:?}", event.kind);
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

Then handle incoming streams. For a single stream:

```rust
connection.accept_event_stream(MyEventHandler).await?;
```

For multiple concurrent streams, drive `accept_uni` and dispatch each
stream to `Connection::handle_event_stream` inside a `tokio::spawn`. The
caller owns the spawn lifetime, concurrency policy, and error handling:

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use review_protocol::server::Connection;

let semaphore = Arc::new(tokio::sync::Semaphore::new(10));
while let Ok(recv) = connection.accept_uni().await {
    let permit = semaphore.clone().acquire_owned().await?;
    let handler = MyEventHandler;
    tokio::spawn(async move {
        let _permit = permit;
        if let Err(e) = Connection::handle_event_stream(recv, handler).await {
            tracing::warn!(error = %e, "event stream ended with error");
        }
    });
}
```

### Integration Tests

Comprehensive integration tests are available in
`tests/unidirectional_streams.rs`, covering:

- Single and multiple concurrent streams
- Error handling and recovery
- Protocol compatibility verification
- Malformed data handling
- Large event processing
- Concurrency limiting

Run tests with:

```bash
cargo test --features client,server
```

### Performance Benchmarks

Performance benchmarks are available in `benches/unidirectional_streams.rs`:

```bash
cargo bench --features client,server
```
